#HTML and CSS of AluraPlus

This is one of my first projects working with HTML and CSS.

I received a project on FIGMA and had to make a website from it.

You can check the site on

https://alvaroxavierf.github.io/AluraPlus/

and

https://alura-plus-kappa-ashen.vercel.app/

This project took me like 4 days and helped me to improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS
